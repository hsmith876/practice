# Mod 1 Project Instructions


## Congratulations! 

You have just been hired by the Data Science team at Health Data Science for the role of Data Scientist. The team considers data preprocessing a useful skill all data scientist should have. In order to develop data preprocessing skills, new Data Scientist are usually paired and tasked with data preprocessing(cleaning). Along with preprocessing the data, the team requires a presentation showcasing your data visualization skills. In particular, they want visualizations that present findings they can turn into actionable insights for stakeholders. The data set used

### Why focus on hospital readmission? 
A hospital readmission is an episode when a patient who had been discharged from a hospital is admitted again within a specified time interval. Readmission rates have increasingly been used as an outcome measure in health services research and as a quality benchmark for health systems. Hospital readmission rates were formally included in reimbursement decisions for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, which penalizes health systems with higher than expected readmission rates through the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program. Since the inception of this penalty, there have been other programs that have been introduced, with the aim to decrease hospital readmission. The Community Based Care Transition Program, Independence At Home Demonstration Program, and Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative are all examples of these programs. While many time frames have been used historically, the most common time frame is within 30 days of discharge, and this is what CMS uses.
## Methodology 
Some areas you can look to examine are movie genres (Thriller, Drama, Comedy, etc.), movie ratings, budget, social media discussion, and critic or user reviews. Your team gets to define its own questions about the movie industry and then use its knowledge of descriptive statistics and the EDA process to try and answer those questions. 

## Data Sources
Microsoft has provided some data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB.org. You are not limited to these data sets! If you find other useful data on the web, you are welcome to include it (but this is not a requirement).

- More data!
  - if you find data you think is helpful, please feel free to ask for instructor help via Slack.


## Deliverables
Your team must prepare a 5 minute presentation that gives the CEO insights as to what type of films they should be creating to meet consumer demand. Your presentation should outline the process you went through and use at least 4 meaningful data visualizations to help illustrate your findings. Your team is expected to use git as a collaborative tool for this project to manage version control and history.  No more than 8 slides.

Be prepared to answer questions such as:
- "how did you pick the question(s) that you did?"
- "why are these questions important from a business perspective?"
- "how did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?"
- "why did you choose a given method or library?"
- "why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?"

## Project Checklist:

 - [ ] Use data from at least two sources
   - [ ] Establish naming conventions for variables and datasets
   - [ ] Clean dataset & record parameters used to clean the data
     - [ ] You may use Pandas or Python functions
     - [ ] Document every step of the cleaning process
     - [ ] Create at least two new features that were not present in the original data sets
 - [ ] Use Pandas and Numpy to generate useful metrics for comparing films

 - [ ] Posted to git repository:
   - [ ] A README.md listing project members, goals, responsibilities, and a summary of the files in the repository
   - [ ] At least 10 commits
     - [ ] Must include short, descriptive commit messages
     - [ ] Each project member should commit at least once
   - [ ] A Jupyter notebook targeted to a technical audience that contains
     - [ ] Clean and commented code so an independent party can replicate your analysis and justify your analytical choices
     - [ ] Code should follow Pep8 standards
     - [ ] Custom functions should be stored in .py file and imported whenever possible
   - [ ] Your final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis
   - [ ] A narrative Jupyter notebook targeted to a non-technical audience that provides:
     - [ ] The purpose of your analysis and why it matters
     - [ ] 4 well annotated visualizations created using Matplotlib/Seaborn
     - [ ] 2 meaningful summary tables
     - [ ] At least four actionable insights (What type of films should they be looking to produce? What should the budget requirements be? Should they recruit certain actors for their films?)
   - [ ] A pdf of no more than 8 slides used in project presentation targeting non-technical audience
     - [ ] Apply consistent and effective formatting to create a “professional” appearing deck
     - [ ] Write an abbreviated high-level overview of methodology
     - [ ] Justify at least 2 concrete recommendations 
     - [ ] include exported visualizations from analysis
     - [ ] Target the presentation to a non-technical audience, avoid jargon
     - [ ] Take no more than 5 minutes to present
